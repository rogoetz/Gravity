## Academics 

I am currently an MSLS student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

My focus is on academic libraries. 

I currently work at Davis Library, in the Federal Documents and Microforms department. 

My undergraduate degree was in History and German Studies from Davidson College.
