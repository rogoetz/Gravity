Hello, all. 

I've been working on wordpress for a while--both a study abroad travel blog and a book review blog--but I've never been remotely involved in anything not through a GUI. 
The entire concept of GUIs, OSs and other stuff is basically entirely new vocabulary to me. Fortunately, I'm a reasonably fast learner.
