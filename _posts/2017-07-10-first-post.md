Hello, all. 

I've been working on wordpress for a while--both a study abroad travel blog and a book review blog--but I've never been remotely involved in anything not through a GUI. 
The entire concept of GUIs, OSs and other stuff is basically entirely new vocabulary to me. Fortunately, I'm a reasonably fast learner. 

I was unprepared, taking this class, to be building my own website with various forms of new languages...but this is going to be quite helpful, I think, even though it's stressful now. 

And, frankly, this is enjoyable. It's not that I always know what I'm doing, but I do know just enough to figure it out 80% of the time...
and I don't think I know enough to be TOO dangerous yet. 

Still, we'll see. Our second project has been to get this site up and running and reasonably personalized, so success. Our third one looks somewhat more challenging, 
but we'll see what happens. 

anyways, first post written in markdown, so...success?
